Apigee OPDK Setup Status
=========

This repository contains an Ansible role that executes an Apigee status action on all components of a node. 

Requirements
------------

None

Role Variables
--------------

| Variable Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| apigee_all | The cannonical name of the apigee-all script |

Dependencies
------------

A list of other roles hosted on Galaxy should go here, plus any details in regards to parameters that may need to be set for other roles, or variables that are used from other roles.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: apigee-opdk-setup-status }
